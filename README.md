Description:
We have a built a simple note taking application which lets the user save their personal notes
and lets them also mark the priority of each note they save.We have also implemented JWT in
the login mechanism.All the user details are stored in the MongoDB Database.The working is
explained in much more detail in the Full report.There is also a section for a user to register and
make an account in the website.

Tech Stack:
->ReactJS Frontend
->Express JS Backend
->MongoDB server.
-> Testing frameworks and "Devops" technologies are mentioned in the full report in more detail.

Steps to run:

Frontend:
run "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
then run "npm start" to run the react application in the 3000 port.The port is set to 3000 by
default but can be changed.

Backend:
run "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
then run "npm run dev" to run the express server in the 4000 port.The port is set to 3000 by
default but can be changed by modifying the .env file.

Database:
We have chosen MongoDB as the database choice for our application.You have to mention the
MongoDB URI in the .env file. The app currently runs on the local mongo community server but
can work with a cloud server also by just changing the URI.
